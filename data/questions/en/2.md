  A gender balanced world is a better world! We all benefit
  from the Istanbul Convention because it requires action
  to change stereotypes and

  - Ending stereotypes increases opportunities for women AND men
  - Educating children about stereotyping changes their attitudes towards violence
  - To challenge our own stereotypical beliefs about gender roles we need to recognise them

By signing up to the Istanbul Convention, the countries involved have committed to taking effective measures to protect women from violence. However, religious communities, charities, police forces and educational establishments also have an ethical responsibility to get involved in combating violence against women. The Istanbul Convention works towards pooling the efforts of all players, thus creating a framework, within which every woman and every man also takes personal responsibility.
