title: The Istanbul Convention should be celebrated because
answers:
  - It improves the legal protection of all women without discrimination
  - Addressing gender inequality achieves BalanceforBetter
  - All actions to end violence against women should be celebrated

Violence against women affects all countries and is a huge issue across
Europe.  It is estimated that 75% of women in Europe experience gender
based violence after the age of 15.

The Istanbul Convention, in the same way as other conventions,
adopts the principle of ‘non-discrimination’.  This means that it
has to be applied without discrimination to all women including
lesbian, bisexual and trans women and in fact encourages states to
apply the domestic violence provisions to men and boys as well. We
all deserve to live a life free from violence.
