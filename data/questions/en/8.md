The Istanbul Convention will help women throughout Europe and elsewhere

Violence against women affects all countries and is a huge issue across Europe.
It is estimated that 75% of women in Europe experience some form of gender-based
violence after the age of 15.

The Istanbul Convention, in the same way as other conventions, adopts the
principle of ‘non-discrimination’ which means it has to be applied to all women
including lesbian, bisexual and trans women.  In fact, states are encouraged to
apply the domestic violence provisions to men and boys as well.

We all deserve to live a life free from violence.
